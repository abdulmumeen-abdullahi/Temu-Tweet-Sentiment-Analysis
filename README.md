# Temu Tweet Sentiment Analysis

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
In the age of digital marketplaces, the interaction between buyers, sellers, and products has become increasingly seamless. One such platform leading this revolution is Temu, a Chinese online marketplace known for its substantial discounts and promotional gifts.
Despite its apparent generosity, user feedback on social platforms like [X (formerly Twitter)](http://twitter.com) suggests a mixed sentimentâ€”ranging from satisfaction to concerns about deceptive marketing tactics and questionable quality.
This project aims to explore and analyze what users are saying about Temu on X by applying sentiment analysis techniques to tweets related to the brand.

## ðŸ”¹ Dataset Description
A custom dataset was scraped using the Twikit API and consists of 1,944 tweets with the following features:
- Username: The X username of the tweet author
- Text: Content of the tweet
- Created At: Timestamp of the tweet
- Retweets: Number of retweets at the time of scraping
- Likes: Number of likes at the time of scraping

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Imported dataset using Pandas
- Defined a text-cleaning function to preprocess tweets (e.g., removing URLs, special characters, emojis)
- Saved processed results into a new column called cleaned_tweet

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Utilized TextBlob to compute:
         - Polarity (positive/negative tone)
         - Subjectivity (objective/subjective language)

- Applied VADER (SentimentIntensityAnalyzer) to compute:
         - Compound sentiment score
         - Classified tweets into Positive, Negative, or Neutral

- Calculated and visualized the distribution of sentiment categories using a doughnut-shaped pie chart
